        <p>
          My I.T. carreer studies started in 2010, when I was fifteen years old and started a computer maintenance course. Since then, my objective is to become a successful software developer and make my work capable of changing people's lives by both improving something or inspiring someone to make something nice, just as I get inspired to try something new everytime I see someone building amazing technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am fascinated by what humans already achieved and by what can be achieved with the use of technology and information, this is what keeps me passionate by new things I see everyday and makes me want to learn and use something new all the time.
